      '''Wally means "a stupid or silly person". But, why the name Wally? 
The app is simple and stupid. It is a game of taps. The user has to tap the screen for making the starting number into 0 or any other target number. Thus, the app name, Wally. 

The app requires Google Sign-In for account creation and to do the challenges. The user has to single/double-tap the screen to increment/decrement the starting number respectively. 

The app is simply for fun without any purpose. It has a ranking system but it's not refined like competitive games. Please, take the app and app content lightly and have some fun tapping...''';
